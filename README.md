Lucas: I think the prelim.R is what got us to rank #80. That is the first dumb algo to see how it all works. The prelim2.R algo works but the prediction values are NA for the test dataset I think. Not that hard to fix. Can you work on that? Prelim2.R also calculates the RMSE which is the test statistic we need to use for this competition.

Please fork over prelim2.R, test it and submit a pull request. Feel free to submit 1 or 2 solutions to Kaggle if you are sure there are no errors/NA in the file.

As always please send me an email with questions or connect on Skype.

Thanks,
Sanjay
