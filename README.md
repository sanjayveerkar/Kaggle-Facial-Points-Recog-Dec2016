I think the prelim.R is what got us to rank #80. The prelim2.R you can now neglect.

The code 'tutorial.R' is the best code and is the most recent submission. It is basically run off the demo on the Kaggle site but is debugged as the demo code had several bugs. It is missing the RMSE calculation that is desirable to add.

As always please send me an email with questions or connect on Skype.

Thanks,
Sanjay
